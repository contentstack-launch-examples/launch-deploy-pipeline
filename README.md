# üöÄ Deploy to Contentstack Launch using GitHub Actions (File Upload Project)

This example demonstrates how to **deploy a file upload project to [Contentstack Launch](https://www.contentstack.com/launch/)** whenever there is a push to the `main` branch ‚Äî using **GitHub Actions** and the **Contentstack CLI**.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before setting up this CI/CD workflow:

- ‚úÖ Your project should already be deployed **once manually** using Contentstack CLI.
- ‚úÖ You must have a valid **`.cs-launch.json`** configuration file in your project (usually generated during the first deploy).
- ‚úÖ Your GitHub repository must include:
  - Project source code
  - A valid `package.json` with a `build` script (`npm run build`)
  - `.cs-launch.json` (in the root or a custom path)

---

## üîê Secrets Setup (Required)

To securely authenticate during deployment, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Navigate to: `GitHub > Your Repo > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`
2. Click **"New repository secret"** and add:

| Secret Name     | Value                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `CSDX_EMAIL`     | Your Contentstack account email   |
| `CSDX_PASSWORD`  | Your Contentstack account password|

---

## ‚úÖ How the Workflow Works

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch:

1. The workflow installs project dependencies.
2. It builds your project using `npm run build`.
3. It logs the most recent commit ID and message for traceability.
4. Then, it authenticates using Contentstack CLI.
5. Finally, it triggers a re-deployment to your existing Contentstack Launch project, uploading any changed files.

---

## üìå Important

- ‚úÖ Make sure you **manually deploy once** using `csdx launch` to set up your project on Launch before relying on this workflow.
- ‚úÖ Your `.cs-launch.json` file must exist in the root (or use `--config` to point to it).
- ‚úÖ Store your email and password in GitHub Secrets as `CSDX_EMAIL` and `CSDX_PASSWORD`.

After this one-time setup, every push to `main` will **automatically update your Launch project** ‚Äî no extra steps needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file at: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deployed to Launch

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check for .cs-launch file
        run: |
          echo "Current directory:"
          pwd
          echo "Files including dotfiles:"
          ls -la

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build the project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Show latest commit ID and message
        run: |
          echo "Latest Commit ID:"
          git log -1 --pretty=format:"%H"
          echo ""
          echo "Latest Commit Message:"
          git log -1 --pretty=format:"%s"

      - name: Install Contentstack CLI
        run: npm install -g @contentstack/cli

      - name: Verify Contentstack CLI Installation
        run: csdx --version

      - name: Set Launch Region
        run: csdx config:set:region AWS-NA

      - name: Authenticate to Contentstack
        env:
          CSDX_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.CSDX_EMAIL }}
          CSDX_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CSDX_PASSWORD }}
        run: csdx auth:login -u "$CSDX_EMAIL" -p "$CSDX_PASSWORD"

      - name: Deploy using Launch config
        run: csdx launch --redeploy-latest
